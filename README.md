#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Answer :
1️⃣ var is a function scoped. can be declared multiple time. old system. we will avoid it.
2️⃣ let is a blocked scoped. can't be declare multiple times. its value can be changed.
3️⃣ const is a blocked scoped too. and can't be redeclared. its value can't be changed.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
Answer:
1️⃣ map() use in loops through an array. it makes a new array with needed items
2️⃣ forEach() use in loops through an array to do something but it doesn't make new array so that doesn't return anything
3️⃣ filter() use in loops through an array and makes new array with only those items which got matched with condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Answer:
1️⃣single line arrow function
2️⃣Multi line arrow function
3️⃣Arrow function with parameter
4️⃣Arrow function without parameter

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
1️⃣ I let us extract values from arrays of objects and assign them to variables in a single line

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
1️⃣ strings wrapped n backticks, allow variable ${} and multiline strings easily those makes code readable . but in string concatenation use + to join strings and for multiline needs \n. those makes code unreadable
